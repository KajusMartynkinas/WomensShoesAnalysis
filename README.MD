# Analyzing Womens Shoes from AliExpress and eBay

## Introduction
This project involves analyzing women's shoe data from two different online platforms: eBay and AliExpress. The analysis is aimed at understanding the pricing strategies and popular price ranges of women's shoes on these platforms. The project is divided into three main Python scripts, each handling a different aspect of the data analysis.

## Files Description
- `aliExpress.py`: Python script for processing and analyzing data from the AliExpress platform.
- `ebay.py`: Python script for processing and analyzing data from the eBay platform.
- `analyzingWomensShoes.py`: Main Python script that integrates data from both platforms to provide comprehensive insights.
- `aliExpress.csv`: Contains the dataset from the AliExpress platform.
- `ebay.csv`: Contains the dataset from the eBay platform.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the Python dependencies required for the project.

## Installation
To run this project, Python 3.x is required. To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command in your terminal:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Run the scripts in the following order to perform a complete analysis:
1. `aliExpress.py`
2. `ebay.py`
3. `analyzingWomensShoes.py`

Each script can be executed with the following command:
python <script_name>.py

Replace `<script_name>` with the name of the script you want to run.

## Data Analysis Overview
- **AliExpress Data Analysis (`aliExpress.py`)**: This script processes the `aliExpress.csv` file, focusing on the analysis of product prices and other relevant attributes from the AliExpress platform.
- **eBay Data Analysis (`ebay.py`)**: Similar to `aliExpress.py`, this script is dedicated to analyzing data from `ebay.csv`, offering insights into the pricing and product range on eBay.
- **Comparative Analysis (`analyzingWomensShoes.py`)**: This script brings together data from both platforms, providing a comparative analysis of price trends, popular price ranges, and other significant metrics.
